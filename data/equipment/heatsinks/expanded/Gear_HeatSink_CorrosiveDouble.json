        "Details" : "In the late 3030s, the nascent Federated Commonwealth deployed experimental double heat sinks with corrosive liquid metal coolants. Obviously developed from the prototypes deployed on Hoff, they could also be combined with regular heat sinks but could not be mounted in the engine, and were three times as big (although still had the same mass). Like their predecessors, maintenance problems meant they decayed within only a few years and were unsuitable for widespread deployment, although they did give the Federated Commonwealth a brief advantage in its early days.",
